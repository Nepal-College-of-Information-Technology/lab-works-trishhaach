# Lab 8: Gender Classification using OpenCV and Pre-trained Deep Learning Model

## Objectives:
- Find the pre-trained CNN Model for gender classification.
- Load the pre-trained model and test images on Google Colab.
- Perform data (image) preprocessing.
- Predict the gender with your test images.

## Background Theory:
### Image Processing using OpenCV in Python:
Image processing with OpenCV in Python involves loading images or video frames, performing operations such as resizing, cropping, and color space conversions, applying filters like blurring and edge detection, detecting objects using techniques such as Haar cascades or deep learning models, and processing video streams by iterating through frames. Basic tasks include reading and displaying images, converting between color spaces, enhancing images with filters, detecting objects, and saving processed results. OpenCV's functionality and ease of use make it a versatile tool for tasks ranging from basic image manipulation to advanced computer vision applications.


### Classical ML vs Deep Learning:
Classical machine learning (ML) typically involves traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees, and logistic regression, which require handcrafted feature extraction and engineering. Deep learning, on the other hand, leverages neural networks with multiple layers to automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw data. It excels in tasks with large amounts of data and complex patterns, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.

### Convolution Neural Network (CNN):
A CNN is a specialized type of neural network designed for processing grid-like data such as images and videos. It employs convolutional layers that automatically learn hierarchical patterns through filters or kernels applied across input dimensions. CNNs are pivotal in computer vision tasks due to their ability to learn directly from raw pixel data, achieving superior performance in tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation compared to traditional machine learning approaches.

## Procedure:

- Model Selection: Choose a pre-trained CNN model for gender classification.
- Environment Setup: Use Google Colab for Python coding with GPU support.
- Load Model: Import TensorFlow or PyTorch to load the selected CNN model.
- Data Preprocessing: Use OpenCV in Python to resize and normalize test images.
- Prediction:Feed preprocessed images into the model for gender prediction.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, utilizing a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) facilitated accurate gender classification through efficient image preprocessing with OpenCV. The model's ability to automatically learn intricate features from raw pixel data underscored its effectiveness in computer vision tasks, demonstrating the robustness and practicality of deep learning for image-based classification applications.
