# Lab 1

## Title: Familiarization with Prolog (Logic Programming)

### Objectives:
1. Download and install SWI Prolog
2. Write Hello World
3. Load/consult a sample knowledge base.

### Background Theory:

#### Programming Paradigm:

#### Logic Programming:

Logic programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around formal logic. Programs are built using rules and facts, rather than imperative commands. The most popular logic programming language is Prolog. It's used in artificial intelligence, expert systems, natural language processing, and more. Logic programming focuses on declarative programming, where you define what you want to achieve rather than how to achieve it.

#### SWI Prolog:

SWI-Prolog is a versatile open-source Prolog interpreter and development environment. It's widely used in academic research, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and more. SWI-Prolog offers an interactive environment for testing and debugging Prolog programs, along with libraries for various tasks such as networking, graphical interfaces, and database connectivity. It's known for its robustness, extensive documentation, and active community support.

### Procedure:
1. Download and install SWI Prolog from its official website.
2. Write a simple "Hello World" program in Prolog.
3. Open the SWI Prolog environment and consult a sample knowledge base provided.
4. Execute queries on the loaded knowledge base to familiarize yourself with Prolog's logic programming paradigm.

### Output:
[Include details about the expected output or screenshots here]

### Conclusion:
This lab introduced the basics of the Prolog programming language using SWI Prolog.
