## Title: Solving the Water Jug Problem in Prolog

### Objective:
1. Write a program to solve the water jug problem.
2. Load/Consult the basic knowledge.
3. Test with same queries (e.g. `state(0,0)`).

### Background Theory:

#### State Space Representation:
State space representation is a mathematical modeling technique used to describe the behavior of a dynamic system over time. It represents the system's state variables as a set of first-order differential equations, typically in matrix form. This concise framework allows for analyzing, simulating, and controlling complex systems in various fields, such as engineering, economics, and physics.

#### Problem Formulation:
Problem formulation involves clearly defining the objectives, constraints, variables, and parameters of a problem in a structured manner. It's about converting a real-world problem into a mathematical or computational model that can be analyzed and solved using appropriate techniques. This step is crucial in problem-solving as it lays the foundation for identifying solutions and making informed decisions.

#### The Water Jug Problem:
The water jug problem is a classic puzzle that involves filling one or more jugs with specific volumes of water using a limited set of operations, such as filling, emptying, and pouring between the jugs. The goal is typically to measure out a specific volume of water using the jugs and operations available, often requiring creative thinking and problem-solving skills to achieve the desired outcome.

### Procedure:
1. Define initial state.
2. Define goal state.
3. Define possible operations.
4. Implement operations.
5. Implement search algorithm.
6. Define termination conditions.
7. Test the program.

### Output:


### Conclusion:
In conclusion, by following the outlined procedure and implementing a Prolog program for solving the water jug problem, one can effectively explore the state space and find solutions through systematic search. Testing the program with various scenarios ensures its reliability and accuracy in tackling different instances of the problem.
