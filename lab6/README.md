# Lab 6: Linear Regression in Python

## Objectives:
- Mount your Google Drive @ Google Colab
- Load dataset (House Price)
- Prepare the dataset and fit the linear regression model
- Test by predicting some values

## Background Theory:
### Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that empowers computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves developing algorithms that enable systems to automatically improve their performance on a task through experience. By identifying patterns and relationships within vast datasets, machine learning algorithms can make predictions, classify data, and make decisions, driving advancements in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.
### Supervised Learning approach:
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data, which means it's provided with input-output pairs during training. The goal is to learn a mapping function from the input to the output, so that it can predict the output for new input data.
### Linear/ Multi-linear regression:
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line to the observed data points. It assumes a linear relationship between the variables, aiming to minimize the difference between the observed and predicted values. Multi-linear regression extends this concept to situations where there are multiple independent variables, allowing for the prediction of the dependent variable based on the combined effects of these predictors.

## Procedure:
1. Setup Google Colab
2. Load Dataset (House Price)
3. Prepare the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical   variables, scale numerical features)
4. Fit Linear Regression Model
5. Test by predicting some values

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, our linear regression model effectively predicted house prices based on features like square footage and number of bedrooms. Further refinement could improve accuracy, but overall, this exercise showcases the practical value of machine learning in real estate valuation.
