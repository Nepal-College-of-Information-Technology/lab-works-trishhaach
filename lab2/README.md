## Title: Building and Consulting the Knowledge Base (KB) in Prolog

### Objective:
1. Create a Knowledge Base by implementing the given family tree.
2. Consult the Knowledge Base in Prolog.
3. Test with some queries.
4. Add some rules to the KB and repeat from step 3.

### Background Theory:

#### Propositional Logic:
Propositional logic deals with propositions, which are statements that can be either true or false. It uses symbols and rules to represent and manipulate these propositions. Key concepts include logical operators like AND, OR, NOT, implications, and equivalences, along with truth tables to analyze combinations of truth values. It's a fundamental part of formal reasoning and the foundation of more complex logical systems.

#### Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining:
- **Forward Chaining**: Starts with known facts and uses inference rules to derive new information until a goal is reached. It's like moving forward from the available data towards the conclusion.
- **Backward Chaining**: Starts with a goal to be proven and works backward through inference rules and known facts to determine if the goal can be reached. It's like starting with the desired outcome and figuring out what needs to be true for it to happen.

#### Production Rule System:
A production rule system is a knowledge representation technique used in artificial intelligence and expert systems. It consists of a set of rules that describe actions or transformations that can be applied to data or knowledge. Each rule typically has a condition (if-part) and an action (then-part). When the condition is satisfied, the action is executed, potentially leading to the modification of the system's state or the generation of new information.

### Procedure:
1. Define family members as facts and relationships as rules in Prolog.
2. Load the Prolog file containing the family tree knowledge base.
3. Test the knowledge base with various queries.
4. Add new rules to enhance the knowledge base.
5. Retest the updated knowledge base with queries to verify functionality.

### Output:

### Conclusion:
This lab highlighted the development of a Prolog knowledge base for a family tree, refining it through testing and the addition of new rules. It underscores Prolog's effectiveness in logical inference and real-world modeling.
